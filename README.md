# Employee Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

🚧 **Work in Progress** 🚧  
This project is currently under active development.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Employee churn (also known as employee attrition) is a significant challenge for organizations, leading to increased recruitment costs, productivity loss, and operational disruption.  

This project aims to develop a **machine learning model capable of predicting the probability of an employee leaving the company**, with the goal of supporting **Human Resources (HR) and management decision-making**.

The focus is on building an **interpretable and business-oriented solution**, rather than a purely technical model.
